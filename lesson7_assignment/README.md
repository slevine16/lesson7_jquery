### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. jQuery conforms to all Javascript rules. Each statement begins with a $ to signify that any code after should be interpreted from jQuery library. 
2. It is possible to traverse the DOM by engaging different jQuery methods. For example, children() selects the child element of each element matched by the main selector. Another one is siblings() that selects the sibling elements of each element matched by the main selector.
3. jQuery includes various visual animation methods. Animations occur in a specific (millisecond) time frame. Some also support slow and fast keywords. One common one is animate() that changes value of one or more CSS properties.
